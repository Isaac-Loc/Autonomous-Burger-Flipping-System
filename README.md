# Autonomous-Burger-Flipping-System
This github repository will be used to store the arduino code that will be used to make our burger flipper functional. It will provide code for all motors used in this project. There will be functional code that will operate the servo motor and DC motors. We will be using the arduino IDE for this project. This project will mostly be developed in C++.

# Instructions
This section will guide you in getting the code in your arduino IDE.
1. Download Github Desktop. Link to download: [Github Desktop Download](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
2. Sign into your github account on Github Desktop
3. Clone this repository to your local files
4. Download the arduino IDE. Link to download: [Arduino Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
5. Open your arduino IDE and click file in the top right
6. Click open and navigate to the path where you cloned your github repository
7. Select the .ino file and click open

# Features
The code provided in this github will provide functionality for all features in this project. Some features include:

### DC Motors 
The DC Motors will be able to move the spatula and meat probe horizontally across the grill

### Servo Motor
The Servo Motor should be able to spin the spatula and successfully flip the patty on its other side

### Laser sensors and sensor receivers 
These laser sensors and receivers should successfully locate the patty on the grill

### Meat probe 
The meat probe should be able to successfully move to the patty and check the patty's temperature correctly

# Required Materials
